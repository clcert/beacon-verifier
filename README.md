# CLCERT/NIST Randomness Beacon Verifier Scripts

Python scripts that verifies the correctness of the values delivered by both CLCERT and NIST Randomness Beacon services.

#### Install requirements

`$ pip install -r requirements.txt`

*The file `sloth.py` is necessary in order to run chain consistency test for CLCERT service.*

### Chain Consistency

Each new pulse that is created by the service must be linked to previous pulses that were created before. In order to achieve that, each pulse must reference to pulses and values committed in the past. Specifically, there are some properties that each pulse in the chain must fulfill in order to preserve the consistency and correctness of the chain:
* Correct reference to previous pulses.
* Use of local random value committed in the valid pulse created immediately before.
* Correct use of hash function to create output value.
* Valid signature.

The script checks all this properties for each pulse and reports if there are any pulses that doesn't fulfill some of this properties.

#### How to Use

```
$ python beacon-pulses-verifier.py [options] [values]

Organization:
--organization {NIST, CLCERT} Select which randomness beacon service to analyze.

Propierties to analyze:
 -a          Run all tests (check all properties).
 -c          Checks only local random value pre-committed.
 -s          Checks only valid signature.
 -o          Checks only correct generation of output value using hash function.
 -p          Checks only reference of previous pulses already created in the chain.

Pulses to verify:
 --init   [value]  Set initial pulse as the one with id [value] to analyze.
 --final  [value]  Set final pulse as the one with id [value] to analyze.
 --random [value]  Checks only [value] pulses selected at random.
 --only   [value]  Checks only the pulse with id [value].

 Optional:
 -v          Verbose mode
```

*Example:* In order to analyze all properties in all the pulses generated by NIST Randomness service in verbose mode:

`$ python beacon-pulses-verifier.py --organization NIST -av`

### Real-Time External Events Verifier (only for CLCERT).

In development, will be available soon.
