# CLCERT Randomness Beacon Verifier Scripts

Python scripts that verify the correctness of the values delivered by the CLCERT Randomness Beacon service.

#### Install requirements

`$ pip install -r requirements.txt`


### Chain Consistency

Each new record that is created by the service it must be linked to the previous records that were created before. In order to achieve that, each record must reference to records and values committed in the past. Specifically, there are some properties that each record in the chain must fulfill in order to preserve the consistency and correctness of the chain:
* Correct reference to previous records.
* Use of local random value committed in the record created immediately before.
* Correct use of hash function to create output value.
* Valid Signature.
* Correct hashing of external events.

The script checks all this properties for each record and reports if there are record that doesn't fulfill any of this properties.

#### How to Use

```
$ python beacon-verifier-script.py [options] [values]

Options:
 -v          Verbose mode
 -a          Run all tests (check all properties).
 -c          Checks only reference of previous records already created in the chain.
 -p          Checks only local random value pre-committed.
 -o          Checks only correct generation of output value using hash function.
 -s          Checks only valid signature.
 -e          Checks only correct hash of external events.
 -i [value]  Set initial record id [value] to analyze.
 -f [value]  Set final record id [value] to analyze.
 -t [value]  Checks only the last [value] records generated.
 -x          Checks only the current active chain
 -w [value]  Set address [value] of beacon web server (only for testing purposes).
```

The most common use of the script would be to analyze all records generated by the beacon in verbose mode:

`$ python beacon-verifier-script.py -va`

### Real-Time External Events Verifier (still in development, available soon)

Checks in real-time that the data extracted by the service from each entropy source is the same data that the user can collect from her point of view. It reports if the data is not the same or if there are some errors in the collection (timeout or server errors).

#### How to Use

```
$ python real-time-verifier.py [options] [values]

Options:
-w [value]  Set address [value] of beacon web server.
```
